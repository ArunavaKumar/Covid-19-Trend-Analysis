# Covid-19-Trend-Analysis
As the Covid-19 outbreaks rapidly all over the world day by day and also affects the lives of million, a number of countries declared complete lockdown to check its intensity. Here I developed an experimental approach to analyse the trend of this pandemic all over the India. For this experiment I mailny used some popular python packages like - **pandas**, **numpy** for computational purpose; **matplotlib**, **plotly**, **seaborn**, **dash** for visualization purpose. Finally I developed a interactive dashboard for displaying the final analysis for each state of India.
